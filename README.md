# React + Vite

1. I have used two different paths in the project.
2. First one is Simply the Base path '/' 
3. Second one is directing the page to cart page using the path '/cart'.
4. Using UseNavigate Hook, I implemented the navigation concept. 
5. NavBar component is created and another things are stored under Pages Directory.[ Home, CartProduct, Cart and Card]


Onclicking the Cart Symbol on the right top corner, the page will be navigated to the Cart Section. Then If we click the home button, it will be redirected to Home Page. These Home and Cart button is added on the NavBar component which is not routed. Routing is performed on Home.jsx and Cart.jsx.
